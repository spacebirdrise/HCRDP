Bioinformatics Code
This code is code I wrote for my research position in bioinformatics.  It's purpose is to take multiple bed files containing information about two different genomes, parse them, then produce result bed files containing circRNA information from each genome side by side for those circRNA found in the same coords from their respective genome.
